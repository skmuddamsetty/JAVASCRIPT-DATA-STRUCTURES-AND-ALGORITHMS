Table: Views

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| article_id    | int     |
| author_id     | int     |
| viewer_id     | int     |
| view_date     | date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article (written by some author) on some date. 
Note that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person.

 

Write an SQL query to find all the authors that viewed at least one of their own articles, sorted in ascending order by their id.

The query result format is in the following example:

Views table:
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
| 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 4          | 7         | 1         | 2019-07-22 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+

Result table:
+------+
| id   |
+------+
| 4    |
| 7    |
+------+

If with distinct keyword,

SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id FROM Views 
where author_id = viewer_id 
ORDER BY id

If order by first, we need another Select and alias

SELECT id from (SELECT author_id AS id FROM Views 
where author_id = viewer_id 
ORDER BY id)a
GROUP BY id

If just with group by (automatically sorted by id)

SELECT author_id AS id FROM Views 
where author_id = viewer_id 
GROUP BY id


SELECT DISTINCT author_id as id
FROM Views
WHERE IF(viewer_id=author_id, 1, 0)=1
ORDER BY author_id
